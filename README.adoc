= oVirt Go SDK

== Introduction

The oVirt Go SDK is a Go package that simplyfies access to the oVirt
Engine API.

IMPORTANT: This document describes how to generate, build and test the
SDK. If you are interested in how to use it read the `README.adoc` file
in the `sdk` directory instead.

== Building

The SDK uses http://www.xmlsoft.org[libxml2] for parsing and rendering
XML documents, and the part that interacts with this library is written
in C. This means that before building you must make sure you have the C
compiler and the required header and libraries files installed in your
system. For example to install with the `yum` package manager you will
need to do the following:

  # yum -y install \
  gcc \
  libxml2-devel

Most of the source code of the Go SDK is automatically generated from
the API model.

The code generator is a Java program that resides in the `generator`
directory.  This Java program will get the API model and the metamodel
artifacts from the available Maven repositories. To build and run it use
the following commands:

  $ git clone https://github.com/CpuID/ovirt-engine-sdk-go.git
  $ cd ovirt-engine-sdk-go
  $ mvn package

This will build the code generator, and run it to generate the SDK for the
version of the API that corresponds to the branch of the SDK that you
are using.

If you need to generate it for a different version of the API then you
can use the `model.version` property. For example, if you need to
generate the SDK for version `4.1.0` of the SDK you can use this
command:

  $ mvn package -Dmodel.version=4.1.0

Output will reside in the directory [sdk](https://github.com/CpuID/ovirt-engine-sdk-go/tree/master/sdk), and can be used
in any Go application with an `import`:

```
import (
  "github.com/CpuID/ovirt-engine-sdk-go/sdk/ovirtsdk4"
)
```

== Testing

The test suite of the project is inside the `sdk` directory. To run
the tests change into the `sdk` directory and execute:

  $ cd sdk
  $ go test
