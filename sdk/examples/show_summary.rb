# This example will connect to the server and display a summary of the
# relevant objects in the system, extracted from the root service:

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = OvirtSDK4::Connection.new({
  :url => 'https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
  :username => 'admin@internal',
  :password => 'redhat123',
  :ca_file => 'ca.pem',
  :debug => true,
})

# Get API information from the root service:
api = connection.system_service.get
puts("version: #{api.product_info.version.full_version}")
puts("hosts: #{api.summary.hosts.total}")
puts("sds: #{api.summary.storage_domains.total}")
puts("users: #{api.summary.users.total}")
puts("vms: #{api.summary.vms.total}")

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close
