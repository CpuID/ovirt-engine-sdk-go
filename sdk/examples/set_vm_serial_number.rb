require 'ovirtsdk4'

# This example shows how to set a custom serial number in a virtual
# machine:

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = OvirtSDK4::Connection.new({
  :url => 'https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
  :username => 'admin@internal',
  :password => 'redhat123',
  :ca_file => 'ca.pem',
  :debug => true,
})

# Locate the virtual machines service and use it to find the virtual
# machine:
vms_service = connection.system_service.vms_service
vm = vms_service.list({:search => 'name=myvm'})[0]

# Locate the service that manages that specific virtual machine:
vm_service = vms_service.vm_service(vm.id)

# Use the "update" method to set a serial number policy and value:
vm_service.update({
  :serial_number => {
    :policy => OvirtSDK4::SerialNumberPolicy::CUSTOM,
    :value => 'myserial',
  },
})

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close
