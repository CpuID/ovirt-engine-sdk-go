require 'ovirtsdk4'

# This example will connect to the server and create a new data center:

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = OvirtSDK4::Connection.new({
  :url => 'https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
  :username => 'admin@internal',
  :password => 'redhat123',
  :ca_file => 'ca.pem',
  :debug => true,
})

# Get the reference to the data centers service:
dcs_service = connection.system_service.data_centers_service

# Use the "add" method to create a new data center:
dc = dcs_service.add(
  OvirtSDK4::DataCenter.new({
    :name => 'mydc',
    :description => 'My data center',
    :local => false,
  })
)

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close
