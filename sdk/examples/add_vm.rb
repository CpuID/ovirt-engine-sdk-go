require 'ovirtsdk4'

# This example will connect to the server and create a new virtual machine:

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = OvirtSDK4::Connection.new({
  :url => 'https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
  :username => 'admin@internal',
  :password => 'redhat123',
  :ca_file => 'ca.pem',
  :debug => true,
})

# Get the reference to the "vms" service:
vms_service = connection.system_service.vms_service

# Use the "add" method to create a new virtual machine:
vms_service.add(
  OvirtSDK4::Vm.new({
    :name => 'myvm',
    :cluster => {
      :name => 'mycluster'
    },
    :template => {
      :name => 'Blank'
    }
  })
)

# Note that when construction an object you can use the above notation,
# that uses a hash with symbols, and nested hashes as their values. It
# is also possible to use directly the constructors of the corresponding
# objects, it is equivalent, but more verbose. For example:
#
# vms_service.add(
#   OvirtSDK4::Vm.new({
#     :name => 'myvm',
#     :cluster => OvirtSDK4::Cluster.new({
#       :name => 'mycluster'
#     }),
#     :template => OvirtSDK4::Template.new({
#       :name => 'mytemplate'
#     })
#   })
# )

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close
