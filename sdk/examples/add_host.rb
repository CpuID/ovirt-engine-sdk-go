require 'ovirtsdk4'

# This example will connect to the server and add a new host:

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = OvirtSDK4::Connection.new({
  :url => 'https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
  :username => 'admin@internal',
  :password => 'redhat123',
  :ca_file => 'ca.pem',
  :debug => true,
})

# Get the reference to the hosts service:
hosts_service = connection.system_service.hosts_service

# Add the host:
host = hosts_service.add(
  OvirtSDK4::Host.new({
    :name => 'myhost',
    :description => 'My host',
    :address => 'node40.example.com',
    :root_password => 'redhat123',
    :cluster => {
      :name => 'mycluster',
    },
  })
)

# Wait till the host is up:
host_service = hosts_service.host_service(host.id)
begin
  sleep(5)
  host = host_service.get
end while host.status != OvirtSDK4::HostStatus::UP

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close
