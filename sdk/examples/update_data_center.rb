require 'ovirtsdk4'

# This example will connect to the server and update the description of
# a data center:

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = OvirtSDK4::Connection.new({
  :url => 'https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
  :username => 'admin@internal',
  :password => 'redhat123',
  :ca_file => 'ca.pem',
  :debug => true,
})

# Get the reference to the data centers service:
dcs_service = connection.system_service.data_centers_service

# Retrieve the description of the data center:
dc = dcs_service.list({:search => 'name=mydc'})[0]

# In order to update the data center we need a reference to the service
# tht manages it, then we can call the "update" method passing the
# update:
dc_service = dcs_service.data_center_service(dc.id)
dc = dc_service.update({
  :description => 'Updated description',
})

# Print the description of the result of the update:
puts "#{dc.name}: #{dc.description}"

# Note that an alternative way to do this is to update the
# representation of the data center, and then send it:
#
# dc.description = 'Updated description'
# dc_service.update(dc)
#
# But this isn't good practice, because it will send to the server all
# the attributes of the data center, not just those that we want to
# update.

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close
