require 'ovirtsdk4'

# This example will connect to the server and add a network interface
# card to an existing virtual machine.

# Create the connection to the server:
connection = OvirtSDK4::Connection.new({
  :url => 'https://engine40.example.com/ovirt-engine/api',
  :username => 'admin@internal',
  :password => 'redhat123',
  :ca_file => 'ca.pem',
  :debug => true,
})

# Locate the virtual machines service and use it to find the virtual
# machine:
vms_service = connection.system_service.vms_service
vm = vms_service.list({:search => 'name=myvm'})[0]

# In order to specify the network that the new interface will be
# connected to we need to specify the identifier of the virtual network
# interface profile, so we need to find it:
profiles_service = connection.system_service.vnic_profiles_service
profile_id = nil
profiles_service.list.each do |profile|
  if profile.name == 'mynetwork'
    profile_id = profile.id
    break
  end
end

# Locate the service that manages the network interface cards of the
# virtual machine:
nics_service = vms_service.vm_service(vm.id).nics_service

# Use the "add" method of the network interface cards service to add the
# new network interface card:
nics_service.add(
  OvirtSDK4::Nic.new({
    :name => 'mynic',
    :description => 'My network interface card',
    :vnic_profile => {
      :id => profile_id
    },
  })
)

# Close the connection to the server:
connection.close
